## Biogeographical Model Selection for Empirical and Simulated Data ##

1. Genetic sequences are in: **data/genus_name/NEXUS/**

2. Revbayes Scrpits using are in: **data/genus_names/revbayes**

2. Phylogenetics Reconstructions are in: **result/genus_name/final/output/**

3. [bin/R](https://github.com/dpabon/bio_comparadaII/blob/master/bin/R): Contain all codes used for AIC calc and Simulations of trees

4. [bin/bin_scaling](https://github.com/dpabon/bio_comparadaII/tree/master/bin/bin_scaling): Cotain scripts for determinated execution time of Revbayes

5. [data/scaling](https://github.com/dpabon/bio_comparadaII/tree/master/data/scaling): Contain data necesary for determinated execution time of Revbayes
